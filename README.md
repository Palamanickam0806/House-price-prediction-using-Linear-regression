**House Price Prediction Project using linear regression**

I'm thrilled to share the results of a recent machine learning project I've been working on! Using linear regression, we developed a model to predict house prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset:train-chennai-sale.csv ðŸ”¹ Key Contributions: Data preprocessing,data visualization, model training, and evaluation 

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world problem. I learned a lot about data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation metrics along the way.

Big thanks to team Bharat Intern for providing such an opportunity. If you're interested in learning more about our process or the details of the project, feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
